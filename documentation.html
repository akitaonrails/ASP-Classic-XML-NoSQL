<p class="subtitle">Introduction</p>
<p>The development of this platform followed some very concrete objectives in 
  order to solve several problems of a variety of degrees. Mainly the problem 
  concentrates in the use of a very poor database-driven content management system. 
  As this system totally broken, is very large and difficult to fix, this platform 
  was made in order to fulfill current emergencial needs while giving more time 
  to re-project the whole system.</p>
<p class="subtitle">Problems</p>
<ol>
  <li>Buggy table system that is very difficult to update and allows for several 
    errors to be presented to the customer. The resolutions of such problems are 
    very punctual and difficult to debug;</li>
  <li>Limited design choices to fit in the current table model what allows for 
    several unpredictable errors in both layout design and software construction;</li>
  <li>There&acute;s no time nor resources to design a complete new content management 
    system, so this must be a low cost and time effective solution as well as 
    providing more quality as a whole</li>
</ol>
<p class="subtitle">Understandings</p>
<ol>
  <li>This is not a simple table edition problem, so the solution doesn&acute;t 
    relies on the building of a &quot;HTML table editor&quot; software;</li>
  <li>There should be an easier way for content staff, developers and designers 
    to have better control on the presentation, construction and update processes;</li>
  <li>The <b>designers</b> should be able to design whichever they want to see;</li>
  <li>The <b>developers</b> should be able to have total control over the data 
    without worring about the rendering methods but only the mid-structuring between 
    the HTML and the data;</li>
  <li>The <b>content staff </b>should never know what goes underneath the complex 
    design and rendering processes and should be able to update the data as quick 
    as pointing and clicking on it;</li>
  <li>The development base should be very consistent and methodic so the developers 
    can have a set of tools and frameworks ready to use for increased productivity 
    on a variety of situations;</li>
  <li>The concept of &quot;data&quot; and &quot;layout&quot; should be known as 
    discrete and independent layers so a &quot;data&quot; file can be easily used 
    with a variety of &quot;layouts&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p class="subtitle">Primary Design Decisions</p>
<ol>
  <li>Develop a platform instead of a stand-alone software. This concept means 
    that the platform should serve as basis for future expantions, though the 
    system should be scalable;</li>
  <li>In a first layer, maintain the data itself as static physical files managed 
    by the OS file system and, at the same time, have the same structure mirrored 
    in a database where more details could be hold and more operations could be 
    performed -- as associating sets of files and giving files other properties 
    than name and type but also author name, description, etc;</li>
  <li>Use XML as the base of every data storage of the system as it&acute;s a 
    proven industry accepted standard and already have very mature tools and components 
    to have increased performance, productivity;</li>
  <li>Create a second layer of easy navigation that fulfills both the developer 
    and the content staff needs and gives them all the visual hints needed for 
    fast understanding;</li>
  <li>Create a top layer of modules and a framework to create them. Each module 
    would fulfill a very specific need of the content;</li>
  <li>As a modular system with a consistent framework, new modules could be developed 
    very fast;</li>
  <li>The front-end of the sites that uses those stored data should be developed 
    with easy, so there should be a parallel layer that allows for fast retrieve 
    of this data. The easiest way is to have a &quot;shortcut&quot; system that 
    links both a XML and a Style/Layout file together;</li>
</ol>
<p class="subtitle">Basic Architecture</p>
<ol>
  <li>main database tables: tbXML_base, tbXML_folders, tbXML_front (respectivelly, 
    for files, folders and shortcut storage);</li>
  <li>TXMLSynchro VBScript Class that encapsulates the complex operations of mirroring 
    file system operations to the database into a very easy to understand interface;</li>
  <li>TXMLFront VBScript Class that encapsulates the retrieving of XML and it&acute;s 
    Style files thru a shortcut in the front-end development;</li>
  <li>An Explorer tool with different features for both developers and content 
    staff (/devmanager and /usermanager);</li>
  <li>Developers should have refined control over the file system as the creation 
    and erasing of files, the edition directly into the XML source code and so 
    on;</li>
  <li>Content Staff should not worry about create anything new but edit the content 
    of the available files using visual tools (/usermodules);</li>
  <li>A Module Framework should be used as a sub-platform to create new modules;</li>
  <li>Primarily create 3 modules: to visually edit Simple Tables, Tree-like Tables 
    and Clone existing files (/mod_simpletable, /mod_treetable and /mod_clonefile);</li>
  <li>To be worked on later: a way to have a visual manager for shortcuts, a way 
    to link XML files between them (almost like a dynamic table relation)</li>
</ol>
<p class="subtitle">TXMLSynchro at a Glance</p>
<p>This is a VBClass (so relies in the MS Scripting Engine 5.x or later) that 
  performs file system operations and mirror the structure to a database table 
  in a transactional manner. So, theoretically, every file or folder created in 
  the file system will have a pair as a table row. It encapsulates operations 
  in the file system and in the tbXML_base, tbXML_folders and tbXML_front tables 
  (Oracle and MS SQL Server compatible).</p>
<p>A file row, or a &quot;file object&quot; has several properties not supported 
  by the native filesystem, as associating a Style and Schema file and having 
  Author, Responsible and Description data recorded at the creation time.</p>
<p>Erase operations use a different concept than straight raw deletion: it only 
  updates the file or folder object&acute;s &quot;is_active&quot; flag and rename 
  it&acute;s physical file or folder appending a &quot;_deleted&quot; string after 
  it&acute;s name. To unerase them it&acute;s only a matter of invoking the CreateFile 
  or CreateFolder methods again. So, instead of creating a brand new file, it 
  will first check the existence of deleted ones and reuse them.</p>
<p>The folder table tbXML_folders also doesn&acute;t follow the standard way of 
  a tree model where each row would represent a node in the tree that have, at 
  least, the pointer to it&acute;s parent node and a description name. Instead, 
  the only &quot;parent&quot; nodes available are the ones called &quot;Root&quot;. 
  Roots define the upper bounds where no operations can be performed above them. 
  All other folders are recorded with their full paths. This is done because all 
  the navigational logic of a tree can be performed using the file system itself 
  and also because it would not be cost effective when there&acute;s a need to 
  fetch a complete path: each node would result a query to fetch it&acute;s parent 
  data and so on.</p>

<p>This class is not supposed to be directly used. It supports the base of the 
  platform and usually only system modules and the author himself will make directly 
  use of it. </p>
<p>Anyway, the functionallity is not finished yet, there are several methods under 
  development but the basic functional set is as presented. The correct way to 
  use it is:</p>
<ol>
  <li>instantiate, Set oSynchro = new TXMLSynchro</li>
  <li>choose between using Oracle or SQL, oSynchro.Oracle = False (default, Oracle 
    = True)</li>
  <li>connect it to a file system and DB connection objects, oSynchro.Connect 
    oFileSystem, oConnection</li>
  <li>set a Root folder, oSynchro.Root = &quot;C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\data&quot;</li>
  <li>set the working folder/file, oSynchro.File = &quot;folder1\file1.xml&quot;</li>
  <li>if you&acute;re creating, invoke the CreateFile, if you&acute;re reading 
    from it, use the ReadFile, and so on.</li>
  <li>NEVER forget to clean up memory, Set oSynchro = Nothing (rule of thumb for 
    clean programming)</li>
</ol>
<pre>
	Set oSynchro = new TXMLSynchro
	oSynchro.Connect objFileSystem, objConnection
	oSynchro.Root = "D:\Inetput\wwwroot\data"
	oSynchro.Path = "folder1\file1.xml"
	(...)
	Set oSynchro = Nothing
</pre>
<p>One can have better undertstanding of the database internals by looking closely 
  at the private method DefineQueries of this class. All SQL commands and queries 
  are centralized inside this method for easy maintainabilitty and cross-platform 
  needs.</p>
<p class="subtitle">TXMLFront at a Glance</p>
<p>The TXMLSynchro class was first designed to be the only class to manage everything 
  about this platform, but soon it was clear that it would not fit well to be 
  used as the front-end interface. That class has around 2000 lines of code and 
  weight around 50kb. So it would be better to have a smaller light-weight and 
  easier Class to encapsulate Shortcut read based operations. That&acute;s the 
  role of TXMLFront.</p>
<p>This class encapsulates the read operation only of the tbXML_front table. This 
  table basically stores ID pointers for 2 rows in the tbXML_base table. The first 
  file is the XML and the other is it&acute;s Layout (in XSL format) for this 
  particular front-end website. The operation that link these 2 files together 
  is available in the developer&acute;s explorer-like interface (discussed later) 
  and is accomplished using the CreateShortcut method of the TXMLSynchro Class.</p>
<p>While developing a website, the mounter (HTML mounter) would cut the desired 
  dynamic table as a XSL Style file that would later fit in the XML designed by 
  the developer. As those 2 files are ready the developer can register them in 
  the platform and create a Shortcut to get it later.</p>
<p>In the front-end website in development the developer would follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>instantiate the class, Set oFront = new TXMLFront</li>
  <li>as before, choose between using Oracle or SQL queries, oFront.Oracle = False 
    (default, Oracle = True)</li>
  <li>give it an opened database connection, oFront.ActiveConnection = oConnection</li>
  <li>now simply give it the shortcut name, oFront.Load( &quot;shortcutname&quot; 
    )</li>
  <li>and then give it the object where to render, oFront.Render Response</li>
  <li>finally, clean up, Set oFront = Nothing</li>
</ol>
<pre>
	Set oFront = new TXMLFront
	oFront.ActiveConnection = objConnection
	oFront.Load( "shortcutname" )
	oFront.Render Response
	Set oFront = Nothing
</pre>
<p>This simple set of 5 lines can dramatically increase maintainability, easy 
  of use, development cycle and decrease the amount of bugs.There will be no more 
  need for thousands of unreadable &quot;For&quot;s, &quot;While&quot;s and &quot;Response.Write&quot;s 
  or &quot;&lt;%=%&gt;&quot;s anymore. Everything will be split off in separated 
  and organized files and tied together by a simple set of 5 lines that calls 
  a simple shortcut.</p>
